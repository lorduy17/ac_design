DISEÑO 


DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS *****
For conventional subsonic airplanes is important consider cd0 for the balance.

** the book say for low velocities q is low and therefore CL is large. This conditions due CDi increases more faster than q_inf decreases and D and hence Tr increase. Cauese the cdi = cl**2/(cte). At the condition of describe the book. The airplane need more CL for reach the Tr.

When the calc the min of function Tr. CDi = CD0 in this point the L/D is max.
 
The potency is inversed proporcianal that CL**(3/2)/CD. So at the velocity for min power_req corresponds to maximun CL**(3/2).
The AERODYNAMIC CONDITIONS for hold minimun power required, the CD0 = CDi/3


***
Define endurence and range are diff for jett and propeller.

Propeller.

Critical factors:
- SFC: specific fue consumtion.

Endurence: min consume pounds of fuel per hour.
 --> So, max endurence occurs when airplane fly at mínimum power required. (CD0 = 1/3 CDi) --> (CL**(3/2)/CD)max
Range: min consume pounds of fuel per mi (fuel/distance)
 --> max range occurs at max L/D.
	
	DEF PROVIDE OF TANGENT POINT OF MIN Pr/V_inf


JET.

Maximum ENDURANCE for a jet airplane occurs when the airplane is flying at minimum
thrust required. (L/D)max

Range. Defined by TSCF*TA/V_inf -> (Ta/V_imf)min = tangent point of line since 0,0 with Tr curve
 --> So occurs in the max of (CL**0.5)/CD

~~ NOTE:
 . For propeller the max endurance and range are defined since Power curve
 . For jet the max endurance and range are defined since Tr curve
